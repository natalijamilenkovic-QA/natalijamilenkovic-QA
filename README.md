🌸 Hi, I'm Natalija Milenković
Junior QA Engineer | Manual & Automation Testing

Analytical and curious by nature, I enjoy exploring how software works and finding ways to improve it.
Currently completing 
IT Bootcamp – QA Manual & Automation Testing, where I’ve gained hands-on experience with UI, API and automation testing.

I believe in structured, clear testing, curiosity, and continuous learning.
